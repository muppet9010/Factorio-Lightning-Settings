[mod-setting-description]
lightning_settings-disable_flash=Disable the bright flash that affects the wider map around the lightning strike area.
lightning_settings-disable_impact_light=Disable the light in the immediate area of the impact point.
lightning_settings-disable_lightning_bolt_graphic=Disable the lightning bolt graphics, but not the impact explosion graphics. This includes the storm cloud and the white arcs to the ground.
lightning_settings-disable_lightning_ground_impact_graphic=Disable the impact explosion graphics when the lightning bolt hits the ground or an entity that isn't a lightning rod (when it would do damage). Does hide ground electric arcs from all strikes; lightning rods, ground & entities.
lightning_settings-disable_lightning_rod_charge_graphic=Disable the effect when the lightning bolt hits a lightning rod and transfers power into it. Does hide ground electric arcs from all strikes; lightning rods, ground & entities.
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound=Set when a lightning strike creates the vanilla Factorio sound effect, a loud cracking sound.
lightning_settings-lightning_frequency_percentage=Change how often lightning happens compared to vanilla Factorio. 0% disables lightning entirely. Vanilla factorio has 1 strike per chunk every 10 seconds.
lightning_settings-lightning_damage_percentage=Change how much damage lightning does to unprotected entities compared to vanilla Factorio. 0% disables all damage entirely. Vanilla factorio does 100 damage per strike.
lightning_settings-lightning_energy_percentage=Change how much energy lightning provides to a power network via a lightning rod entities compared to vanilla Factorio. 0% disables all energy entirely. Vanilla factorio provides 1,000 MJ energy per strike, although lighting rods generally have low capture percentages of this.
lightning_settings-scale_lightning_rod_energy_source_to_lightning_settings=If the capacity and drain of lightning rods is scaled inline with the lightning frequency and energy settings. Specifically the settings "__1__" and "__2__". For example when enabled lighting strikes happening half as often for twice the energy will have the same cumulative factory power generation as vanilla Factorio lightning strikes.

lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-all=All strikes
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-unprotected=Unprotected areas only
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-none=Never



[string-mod-setting-description]
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-all=All lightning strikes will create the vanilla Factorio lightning strike sound.
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-unprotected=Only strikes in to unprotected areas (outside of lightning rod areas) will have a sound. So the explosions aren't silent.
lightning_settings-lightning_bolt_sound-none=No lightning strikes will ever make a sound.
