# Factorio-Lightning-Settings



Allows control over lightning on Fulgora. Can change both the visuals & sounds, plus the frequency and impact of lightning.



Features
---------

- Can disable the local light and bright screen flashing from lightning strikes.
- Can disable the lightning strike graphic so there's no bright white lines on screen.
- Can control when the lightning sound plays.
- Can control the frequency and effect of lightning strikes.



Options
---------

- Options to control when the lightning makes a sound. Can be always, never, or when a lightning strike occurs outside of a protected area and makes an explosion effect.
- Options to make the lightning more and less frequent. Also to set the energy and damage values per lightning strike. For example allows for changing the frequency of lightning strikes, but keeping the cumulative impact from them. Each can also be fully disabled independently.



Limitations
---------

- This mod only affects the vanilla lightning on Fulgora. Any modded lightning or planets will be unaffected.
