Options to hide graphics entirely. Option to keep the explosion effect when something up-protected is hit for the impact explosion, this can include empty tiles being hit though (all or nothing). But remove all of the effects a hit is within a standard protected base area. Would be missing the lightening strike for unprotected areas so then would be just a random explosion. In regular map only outside the base would be getting these explosions unless player has been bad.
Advanced would be to have option for lightning graphics when hitting a non protected target and nothing when hitting a lightning rod or a random tile (non target). Would need 2 types of lightening with different target list exemptions. Would technically create extra strikes on the borders between protected and unprotected, but as protected would be invisible I think this is fine in reality. Maybe could have un-protected real targets crating just the visuals of lightning as an extra entity trigger effect when only a real target is hit by an explosion, but might not have the right state data to do this purely prototype side.
